After intense efforts, the agents have established the general purpose of the machine (a graph clock), as well as the functionality behind the mysterious circuit board. 

During the technical phase of solving the tricky mission, agents have noticed the importance of the parallelism when applied to the problem of inverting a $Laplace$ transform.
Our solution presents the serial implementation of the $EULER$ algorithm as well as $Abate-Dubner$ algorithm. We have also parallelized the $EULER$ algorithm
and presented the speedup achieved through parallelization and have discussed the resulting efficiency and how it relates to the problem-size.

Due to the mass benefits brought forth by parallelism we anticipate the existence of a cluster of such machines, perhaps in the cloud (figure~\ref{fig:cloud}). 
We therefore advise the secret service to further investigate this and locate the remaining instances (for example through random polling).

%As a final statement, we recommend to discuss with our American counterparts if there is need for invading the country.
