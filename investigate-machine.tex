The forensics team started by investigating the physical exterior of the machine, looking for clues which may allude to its function. This section discusses their methodologies and findings in detail.


\subsection{Technical number enquires}

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{Technical enquiries phone number}
	\label{fig:technical-enquiries}
\end{figure}

The message in Figure~\ref{fig:technical-enquiries} was prominently displayed near the top of the machine. A look up of historical phone directory records traced the number back to the \emph{ORSA Journal on Computing}. 
A follow up visit was made to their customer services branch (Figure~\ref{fig:orsa-map}):

\begin{quote}

Catonsville, Maryland 21228-4664 \\

\end{quote}

\end{figure}

The team was then able to retrieve an excerpt\footnote{An online version was independently found at \url{http://www.columbia.edu/~ww2040/Fall03/LaplaceInversionJoC95.pdf}} of a document \emph{Numerical Inversion of Laplace Transforms of Probability Distributions}.


\subsection{Cyrillic script}
Some Cyrillic script was found on the machine, believed by our Business and Strategy experts to be used for marketing the machine in the Russian market.

An image of the script was analysed and translated electronically (Figure~\ref{fig:cyrillic-script}), yielding the rough English translation of \emph{Fast inverter integrated functions}.

\end{figure}

It is speculated that this marketing campaign was highly unsuccessful, as the marketing text consisted merely of a catchy phrase with no detailed description of operation \footnote{Catchy marketing phrases are clearly an inferior marketing technique, and would never work --- c.f. ``Just do it'' and ``I'm lovin' it'' for examples of such unsuccessful campaigns.}. Additionally, the provided help instructions were provided in a crude mixture of English and French, probably unhelpful for the Russian operators.




\subsection{Geographic coordinates}
The geographic coordinates $2.3328700E \; 48.8074800N$ were found inscribed on the machine. However, due to a lack of 3G signal in the basement, the geographic team were unable to access the internet and hence encountered difficulties in determining the whereabouts of the coordinates inscribed on the machine. The issue was promptly escalated to the CTO, who commissioned the purchase of two horses from a local supermarket. \footnote{Despite the falling price of petrol, it remains beyond our budget. As a plus, horses are also free to park.}

The location was found to be near the Laplace train station in France (Figure~\ref{fig:laplace-horses}). Realising the mismatch in units due to the ``inverse function'' applied to the coordinates, the agents determined that the devious scheme was intended to be a very subtle hint that the machine may be performing an inverse Laplace transform. In order to cut costs, the horses were auctioned off at the nearby \emph{Square du Serment de Koufra} for a profit of \EUR{7.89}. This was sufficient to purchase baguettes for lunch.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Portrait}

A grayscale portrait was located on the central axis of the machine (Figure~\ref{fig:euler}). As the portrait's CMYK band was much too narrow for our forensic experts' eyes, an image was instead captured and sent to the \textcolor{google-blue}{G}l\textcolor{google-red}{O}bal cl\textcolor{google-yellow}{O}ud-based \textcolor{google-blue}{G}enealogy \textcolor{google-green}{L}ocator \textcolor{google-red}{E}-service (\google). The subject was identified as Leonhard Euler,``a pioneering Swiss mathematician and physicist'' (according to an omni-reliable, omni-malleable source \footnote{Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia}). This may hint that the machine employs Euler's methods for its computation.

\subsection{Wall clock and CRT Display}

The machine panel has two seemingly, and deceivingly, unrelated components.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{img/clock.jpg}
	\caption{The wall clock located on the main panel of the machine}
	\label{fig:clock}
\end{figure}

Firstly we have the wall clock (Figure ~\ref{fig:clock}), indicating the current time (as clocks do) to be $3:55$, or more likely $15:55$ given the sunlight in the background. Since Nukehavistan is located around $31N$ latitude (Figure~\ref{fig:map}), we are not dealing with a case of midnight sun\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun}}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{img/nukehavistan.jpg}
	\caption[A map of the Republic of Nukehavistan]{A map of the Republic of Nukehavistan \protect \footnotemark}
	\label{fig:map}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{Image courtesy of The Onion \\ \url{http://www.theonion.com/articles/us-intelligence-nukehavistan-may-have-nuclear-weap,1373/}}


Secondly we have the CRT display (Figure~\ref{fig:crt}), which shows a graph of some function $f(t)$ over time. The graph has a positive peaks at $t = 3$ and a negative peak at $t = 11$. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{img/crt.jpg}
	\caption{The CRT display showing a live graph in neon-ish green.}
	\label{fig:crt}
\end{figure}

After copious degrees of analysis, it was determined that the peaks in the graph are actually mirroring the hands of the clock, the positive peak representing the position of the hour hand (rounded down to the current hour), and the negative peak representing the position of the minute hand (rounded down to the nearest multiple of five). The fact that the $t$ axis runs from $0$ to $12$ further supports this argument. Thus the graph in the image points at $3$ (as is the current hour) and $11$, translating to minutes $55-59$ (as is the current minute).

The circuit board is therefore used to plot a curve representing the current (12-hour) time (Figure~\ref{fig:essentially}).

\end{figure}

Our agent from the "Hidden special unit for reverse analysis and decompilation" was able to successfully decompile the mysterious `mistery.o` file and write the equivalent C++ code. Further testing combined with the latest research in the filed of Reasoning about programs confirmed that our code produces exactly the same results as the initial object file. Below are the pseudo-code function calls that are used to compute the final answer: 

-- insert here the pseudo-code for functions ---

We would like to report some anomalies we have detected in the file, which we believe that have been put in place by the circuit designer in order to make the disassembly process more difficult:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Extra strings.
 We have noticed 2 ambiguous strings written at the beginning of the file: <INSERT HERE THE STRINGS>. They provide some insights into who wrote the initial software and the year it might have been written. 
 \item $y = (x)^782768$, where x = 0.99999999999999 
 Due to the fact that 0.99999999999999 < 1 and because floating point numbers can't be represented exactly by the 64bit processors, the results of this multiplication will be 0. Throughout the run of our program we have determined that the x values never changes so the result is always 0.
 \item stdlib sincos(x) and log(x + 1) functions
 The argument for the sincos function is y and (y + 1) for the log function, where y is the results of the multiplication discussed above. Because y is constant, sincos(y) returns (0,1) and log(y+1) returns 0;
 \item Bogus while loops
 During the research our agent has identified 4 repetitive structures. One repetitive structure is used to compute $y = (x)^782768$ in a very ineffective way. The other 2 repetitive structures have the same implementation and they serve as iterators through the 2 initial strings defined in the program. Their main purpose is to compute the offset between a specific ASCII character ( 0x80 ) and the initial strings. Because the strings are hard-coded, the results computed by both the strings will be always 35 ( 0x23 ) and 49 ( 0x31 ). 
 Lastly, the 4th structure is the "main" while loop. The repetitive condition for this loop is as follows: $(0x31 + sin(y) + cos(y) + log(1+y) - 29 - 48 + y) > 20$, which simplifies to $(7 + sin(y) + cos(y) + log(1+y) > 20)$. Because y is a constant (0), $log(1+y) + sin(y) + cos(y)$ will be 1, so the loop condition is will never be true $8 > 20$.
 Our agent is not sure whether these assembly artifacts and a lot of hard-coded values have been inserted in order to trick us or the compiler just generated general purpose code. 
 \item Compiler uses the stack base pointer (RBP)
 During the analysis, it has been found that the L() function does not properly set the stack base pointer and instead it uses it as a general purpose register. This implies the fact that new variables are not created on the stack. The compiler is aware at compile time of the total number of variables used in the program and this is a known technique used by compilers in such situations. 
  
\end{itemize}

During the decompilation process our agent has used a test-driven approach, by writing scripts that would automate testing our computed function against the original "mistery.o" one. We used the program \textbf{faketime} in order to generate 1440 tests cases: 1 test for each minute in a day. Then we used a parallel diff program that would call both our function and the original L() one with different parameters and report any different results. Part of the tools used by the agent were the GNU Debugger gbd, with the peda plugin and the IDA program. No automated tools have been used ( because there is none for 64bit programs ).
